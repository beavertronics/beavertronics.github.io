So, this is just a bare frame I made (9/30/24) for adding comments to your HTML files when you add / modify them.

Head:
    <!--
    things that link to different files
    such as CSS or Javascript
    The page title (that you see on the top of the tab) and the image displayed
    is also assigned here.
    -->

Header:
    <!-- 
    there is javascript (in /shared/JS/script.js) that injects a header
    that is used on every page. this header includes:
    - the dropdown menu,
    - links to pages on top bar
    - beavertronics icon 
    - beavertronics title
    -->

Body:
    <!-- 
    this is the main body that contains everything 
    -->

Footer:
    <!-- 
    similar to above with the header, there is Javascript that injects a universal footer
    this footer includes:
    - links to socials
    - link to Dr. Meirings email
    - access to credits page
    - access to feedback page
    - access to old website
    -->
