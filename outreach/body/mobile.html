            Since the beginning of our team, we have run an annual summer camp for elementary through middle school students in the Beaverton area! We charge a small materials fee for participation. Any leftover revenue goes towards supporting our team -- which just allows us to further enhance our community involvement!
            <br><br>
            Activities include LEGO robotics, an egg drop, and tie-dye shirts using chemistry concepts!
            <br><br>
            Unfortunately, during the coronavirus social distancing measures, we were unable to host our summer camp for the 2020 summer. But we look forward to supporting campers next summer! Get a head start now and contact our lead mentor, Dr. Heather Meiring, for more information at heather_meiring@beavertonk12.or.us!

            During the 2019 offseason, our team partnered with D.W. Fritz (one of our sponsors) to organize the FIRST Chance offseason event. At FIRST Chance, competition roles can only be filled by those who have never experienced that position! Whether you're a new member or a veteran trying out a new set of skills, FIRST Chance offers a one-of-a-kind learning experience!
            <br><br>
            We hope to continue this event in the future. The coronavirus social distancing measures have prevented the repetition of FIRST Chance into the 2020 offseason, but we would love to see this event live on once it is safe to do so.

            One of our favorite traditions on Beavertronics is to visit the STEM nights of our local Beaverton School District elementary schools. We showcase our robot and train younger students how to safely drive! Plus, we require everyone involved to wear safety glasses. :)

            team of Beavertronics robotics students partnered up with the Beaverton High chapter of Best Buddies and the Beaverton High Specialized Education Department to create custom fidget toys for students with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Fidget toys and handheld self-regulation devices that help students focus on a task at hand. Many people are familiar with fidget spinners, but fidgets can come in any shape, size, or function!
            <br><br>
            Each robotics student interviewed a peer who experiences disabilities, asking them about their interests and needs (e.g. what kinds of motions are most pleasing to the user, as well as sounds, textures, etc.).
            <br><br>
            Students designed everything from a squishable Gary the Snail to a spring-loaded T-Rex car! <!-- Please enjoy the slideshow to the right. -->
