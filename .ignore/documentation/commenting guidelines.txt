So, this is just a bare frame I made (9/30/24) for adding comments to your HTML files when you add / modify them.
Below are templates for what comments should be above the head, header, body, and footer:
    Head:
        <!--
        things that link to different files
        such as CSS or Javascript
        The page title (that you see on the top of the tab) and the image displayed
        is also assigned here.
        -->

    Header:
        <!-- 
        there is javascript (in /shared/JS/script.js) that injects a header
        that is used on every page. this header includes:
        - the dropdown menu,
        - links to pages on top bar
        - beavertronics icon 
        - beavertronics title
        -->

    Body:
        <!-- 
        this is the main body that contains everything 
        -->

    Footer:
        <!-- 
        similar to above with the header, there is Javascript that injects a universal footer
        this footer includes:
        - links to socials
        - link to Dr. Meirings email
        - access to credits page
        - access to feedback page
        - access to old website
        -->


In general when commenting files, you should break the current line and go down one when the line stretches too far to the right. Like this:
    # this is a long sentence my favorite color is green did you know that bees should
    # woah I just started a new line thats so cool!

More specifically with HTML, comments should be formatted like this:
    <!--
    aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
    -->

With Javascript, comments should be like this
    // aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
    // bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb
    // cccccccccccccccc
    function do_something() {}
