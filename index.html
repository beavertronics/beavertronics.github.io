        ABOUT OUR TEAM
    </h1>
    <p class="text-content">
        We compete in the FIRST Robotics Competition to learn lessons in perseverance, teamwork, and a plethora of technical skills. Our team, <b>which is 100% student led</b>, spends 6 short weeks every year working almost around the clock to design and build a competitive robot. Beyond this, we participate in a variety of community outreach events to engage those around us in STEM fields because we know the importance of getting young people excited and interested.

                <b>DESIGN</b>
                <br><br>
                Our team strategically designs each robot with feasability, simplicity, and awesomeness all in mind, based on a thorough analysis of each year's game. We experiment with ideas by making prototypes out of scrap wood. Once we have a good idea of what we want the robot to do and how we want it to do it, we flesh out the details using Onshape, a cloud-based CAD software. Finally, the CAD is thoroughly reviewed, both by students and by our experienced mentors, before manufacturing and assembly take place.</div>
