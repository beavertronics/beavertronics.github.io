        <h3 class="AAAAAA">WARNING</h3>
        <p><strong>Before you begin, hear this: You will probably have to redo your CAD, <em class="AAAAAA">from scratch,</em> at least 3 times.</strong> Prepare yourself mentally for this.</p>

        <h3>CAD/Onshape Basics</h3>
        <p>CAD is short for Computer Aided Design. Basically, we make a 3D model of the robot before building it in real life.</p>
        <p>Onshape is the software we use to do CAD. There are other CAD software,
            such as Fusion360 and Solidworks, but we don't use those, we use Onshape.</p>
        <p>To get free access to Onshape, <a href="https://www.onshape.com/en/education/sign-up">click here to create a student account</a>.</p>
        <p>To learn the easy-peasy basics of onshape, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2utLjjkXpIg">this tutorial</a> is pretty good.</p>


        <h3>CAD Golden Rules</h3>
        <blockquote>If it feels like you are doing something over and over again, CAD has a way to make that faster.</blockquote>
        <p>This is almost universally true, and you get the sense for it after a while, like, "I feel like there has to be a faster way to do this". 
            Onshape in particular is designed to save you time, so if it feels like you're doing busy work, I guarantee there's a smarter way to do it.
            Talk to people who know more about CAD.
        </p>
        <blockquote>READ THE GAME MANUAL A LOT!!!!</blockquote>
        <p>You need to have a very good understanding of the rules in order to make a CAD that will pass inspection,
            and you need a very good understanding of the game itself in order to design a robot that actually wins matches.</p>

        <h3>Assemblies VS Part Studios</h3>
        <p>The way to think about it is like this: Part Studios are where you CAD <em>individual parts</em>, and Assemblies 
            are where you arrange parts together. There are a few rules that follow naturally from this:
            <ul>
                <li>Don't move parts around in a Parts Studio; instead, move them around in the Assembly. It's OK if they intersect/overlap in a Parts Studio,
                    as long as they don't in an assembly.
                </li>
                <li>Never CAD the same part twice. If you need a copy of a part; ie, I need 2 wheels, not just one, import the same
                        part from the Parts Studio into your Assembly twice.</li>
                <li>You should always import parts into Assemblies, not Part Studios.</li>
            </ul>
        None of these are hard-and-fast rules, but don't break them unless you have a good reason to.</p>

        <h3>Importing Parts</h3>
        <p>You don't have to CAD Standard Hardware (Nuts, bolts, washers, etc)- It can be found under the "Standard Content" tab in "Insert".</p>
        <p>In fact, almost all parts you can find in our shop already have CAD models. To get access to them, go 
            to the onshape app store, search for <a href="https://cad.onshape.com/appstore/apps/Manufacturers%20Models/6004ec5e83c40b107c183347">FRCDesignApp</a>, 
            and click Subscribe (it's free). This will give you a little button that you can click to import parts.</p>

        <h3>Bolts, Rivets</h3>
        <p>We use #10-32 bolts and 3/16" rivets for most fastening needs. Rivets are faster to assemble, but they don't work for as many scenarios.
        </p>
        <p> If you're using bolts, try to have as few as possible to constrain the part- It is 
            pretty difficult to snap a steel bolt, and they take time to assemble, so don't use 10 billion of them (one is usually enough). If you're still worried, 
            use a chonkier bolt (1/4-20 for instance) instead of adding more bolts. If you are putting a bolt through 1x1 or 1x2 tubing, the bolt will try to crush the tube.
            To avoid this, make it so that the bolt goes through only one side of the tube and add clearance holes.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you're using rivets, there is more to think about. Make sure that the forces on your structure are sideways- rivets are very strong against sheering
            but they are weak if you try to pull them out. It's reasonable to include 3 or 4 rivets between 2 parts, but more than that is usually overkill.
        </p>
        <p>The most important thing to think about with fasteners is access- can we get to them easily to install/remove them when the structure is assembled? If no,
            you need to fix it. Keep your clearance holes big where possible (preferrably 3/4") and the mechanical people will appreciate it.
        </p>
        <p>Finally, if you're CADding bolt holes, just CAD a point in your sketch and then use the Hole tool. This lets you select the actual bolt you are using
            (ie #10-32) instead of having to memorize the correct hole diameter (like 0.201" or something). This is more clear to people looking at CAD, and also 
            more resistant against silly mistakes.
        </p>

        <h3>How do I CAD gearboxes, belts/pulleys, and chain/sprockets?</h3>
        <p>It's tricky to get the spacing just right for gears, belts/pulleys, chain/sprockets, etc. To help, there are some handy calculators on
            <a href="https://www.reca.lc/">ReCalc</a>- the most useful ones are the Belt Calculator, the Chain Calculator, and the Gear Spacing Calculator.</p>
        <p>We have a lot of these components already- you can see which ones we have and how many at the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14EnzYybJ5NCyudB23L_Pemw4qqw0XF82XgHz-fuCoE4/edit?usp=sharing">Shop Inventory</a></p>
        <p>Some Notes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A belt labeled 655-5M does NOT have 655 teeth; it is 655 millimeters, and at 5mm per belt tooth, is 131 teeth.</li>
            <li>All of our belts are HTD-5M belts, which have 5mm pitch.</li>
            <li>Some of our belts are 9mm wide, and others are 15mm</li>
            <li>All of our gears are 20DP</li>
            <li>We have mostly #35 chain and sprockets, but we have some #25 stuff also.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What am I even trying to make?</h3>
        <p>The robot consists of multiple subsystems. Not every robot has every subsystem- ie, some years, you don't need a climb.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Climb: This allows the robot to climb.</li>
            <li>Shooter: This launches game pieces.</li>
            <li>Drivetrain/Drivebase: This allows the robot to drive, and is BY FAR the most important subsystem. The term "drive<em>train</em>" refers just to the mechanical 
                stuff that transfers power from motors to wheels, wheras the term "drive<em>base</em>" refers to the wheels, the frame, and the electronics; 
                all the stuff that's require to drive. These terms are somewhat interchangable, though.
            </li>
            <li>Intake: Moves game pieces into the robot. These come in 3 major types: 
                <ul><li> Over the bumper: The game piece is rolled up the bumper and into the robot</li>
                    <li>Through the bumper: The game piece is pulled in through a gap in the bumper (not always legal)</li>
                    <li>Under the bumper: The game piece goes under the bumper and then gets pulled into the robot.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Indexer: This is the least well defined subsystem. It's job is simply to get game pieces from the intake to the shooter, without jamming.
                Sometimes you can design your intake to feed directly into your shooter, but other times (especially in games where you control more than one game piece)
                that's not a good idea.
            </li>
            <li>End Affector- There are 2 ways to move game pieces through the robot. You can have a part of the robot that grabs and moves with the game piece,
                    or you can have each part of your robot be stationary, just passing the game piece along to the next stage. If you grab and move with the game piece, 
                that's called an End Affector. End effectors are typically located on the End of an arm, and they Affect the game piece, so that's why they're named that way.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I find that the best way to get ideas is to google for pictures of other teams' robots. For example, an image search for 
        <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=frc+intake&udm=2">"frc intake"</a> turns up a wealth of useful ideas.</p>
        <p>This website has a compilation of many successful robots and their subsystems: <a href="https://www.projectb.net.au/resources/robot-mechanisms">Mechanism Encyclopedia</a></p>

		<h3>Teams to Learn From</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://www.team254.com/first/">Team 254</a>- They have very good season and robot documentation and are consistently a very good team.</li>
			<li><a href="https://www.1690orbit.com/robots">Team 1690</a>- All of their CAD is freely available, and they do a good job not overcomplicating things.</li>
		</ul>
